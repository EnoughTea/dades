# Flat textures #

All wose_*.dss were generated with **texconv** tool from [DirectXTex project](http://directxtex.codeplex.com/)
These images use a sprite of a *Wose* from the great game "[Battle for Wesnoth](http://http://wesnoth.org/)". Give it a try sometime.
Note that some of the generated images are marked as *empty*: they have only correct header for their format, but no pixel data.

# Cube-maps #

Cubemaps were generated with [AMD's cubemap generator](http://code.google.com/p/cubemapgen/)
Image data came as a result of a Google image search without any copyright mention, I have no idea if it belongs to anyone or not.

# Volume textures #

Noise3D.dds is a standard noise texture from DirectX SDK.
